#Programming languages offer a method of storing data for reuse. If there is a greeting we want to present,
# a date we need to reuse, or a user ID we need to remember we can create a variable which can store a value. In Python,
# we assign variables by using the equals sign (=).

message_string = "Hello there"
# Prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)

#Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_).
# They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter (e.g., cool_variable_5 is OK).

# Greeting
message_string = "Hello there"
print(message_string)

# Farewell
message_string = "Hasta la vista"
print(message_string)

#Above, we create the variable message_string, assign a welcome message,
#and print the greeting. After we greet the user, we want to wish them goodbye.
# We then update message_string to a departure message and print that out.

# We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast!
meal = "An english muffin"

# Printing out breakfast
print("Breakfast:")
print(meal)

# Now update meal to be lunch!
meal = "burrito"

# Printing out lunch
print("Lunch:")
print(meal)

# Now update "meal" to be dinner
meal = "pasta"
# Printing out dinner
print("Dinner:")
print(meal)
